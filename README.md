# ! THERE'S A PRESENTATION INCLUDED IN THE REPOSITORY WHICH SUMS UP AND SHOWS MY APP ! (LastProjectTodoApp.pptx)

# Description of the App : TodoListApp
 This webapp will display a todo list which is customizable as you wish. You can see then what you have to do and all the tasks you haven't done yet (for example homeworks for nextweek)
 So the purpose of this app is to manage your time, to see clearly what's missing and to organize yourself for later. It can be use for project planning 
 
# Functionnalities 

You can add a task/todo to an existing TodoList as you can create a new TodoList. Of course you can delete a todo and the todolist if you want to delete them 

As it's a webapp, the frame will be well fitted using ReactJS library for the those severals componants (AddTodo.js - TodoList.js...)


# How to launch the app 

- Install NodeJS
- Install MySQL (you can use WAMPServer), log in to your database (default username : root / no password)
and create a database named todoapp
- Download the repository 
- Import todoapp.sql in your database (there's all queries required to set up the database)
- Launch a prompt command
- Go to the repository and type : npm install
- type : cd client
- type again : npm install
- then npm start 

# Comments 
I didn't present my app on Monday 18/01/2021 (couldn't attend for personal reasons) so I planned to present on Monday 25/01/2021 but the course has been canceled. So you can find my presentation of the app (unfortunately not in live) in my ppt LastProjectTodoApp.pptx
